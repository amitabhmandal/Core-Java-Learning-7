//IMPORTANT POINTS
// 1. Thread group is a java class present in java.lang package
// 2. It is direct child class of Object class
// 3. A group of threads is called thread group which is based on functionality we can group 
//    threads into a single unit.
//    Advantage of grouping thread is that we can do thread management very easily. Thus common
//    operations becomes very easy. That is for example, set the maxPriority of all the sub 
//    group threads very easily.
//    Thread group can also contain sub-thread groups
// 4. Every thread in java belongs to some thread group
// 5. Basic of thread Group 
//    At the top of the figure's structure is the system thread group. The JVM-created system 
//    group organizes JVM threads that deal with object finalization and other system tasks, 
//    and serves as the root thread group of an application's hierarchical thread-group 
//    structure. Just below system is the JVM-created main thread group, which is system's 
//    subthread group (subgroup, for short). main contains at least one threadâ€”the JVM-created 
//    main thread that executes byte-code instructions in the main() method.
//    
//    Below the main group reside the subgroup 1 and subgroup 2 subgroups, 
//    application-created subgroups (which the figure's application creates). 
//    Furthermore, subgroup 1 groups three application-created threads: thread 1, thread 2, 
//    and thread 3. In contrast, subgroup 2 groups one application-created thread: my thread.

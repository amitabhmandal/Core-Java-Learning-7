STATIC NESTED CLASS:

------------
DEFINITION : If a nested class has been declared as static then it is called static nested class
------------


*******
RULE #1
*******
As with class methods and variables, a static nested class is associated with its outer class. 
And like static class methods, a static nested class cannot refer directly to instance variables or methods 
defined in its enclosing class: it can use them only through an object reference.



*******
RULE #2
*******
Static nested classes are accessed using the enclosing class name:
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass

For example, to create an object for the static nested class, use this syntax:

OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject =
     new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();

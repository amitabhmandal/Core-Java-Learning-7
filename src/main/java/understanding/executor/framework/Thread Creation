Requires 3 things
1. Always have an instance of Thread class
2. Provide the task definition by providing an implementation of the run() method of 
Runnable interface
3. Call the start() method on the thread class.

There are number of ways in which thread can be created differs in the 

The mechanism using which the 
1. How the thread object is created
2. The task is created(How do we provide the runnable implementation)

The way these two objects are brought together and made to collaborate
How do we provide runnable implementation to the thread class object so that 
a seperate thread of execution can be spawned and the task can be executed in that.

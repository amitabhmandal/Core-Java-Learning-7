As of today, there are 4 GC algorithms available in the Java Hotspot VM:

The Serial GC - recommended for client-style applications that do not have low pause time requirements.

The Parallel GC - use when the throughput matters.

The Mostly-Concurrent GC (also known as Concurrent Mark-Sweep GC(CMS)) - use when the latency matters.

The Garbage First GC (G1) - new GC algorithm, for CMS replacement.
